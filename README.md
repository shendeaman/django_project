**Expense sharing application:**
1. What is the purpose of the application?
   The application's primary purpose is to track the expenses shared amongst users in a group. A group can have any number of members and they may share the bills,
   Our application keeps track of these expenses.
2. How does the application work?
   Presently, the application is divided into a few sections. The first one deals with creating a group for which one needs to click on 'Add groups', which tries to fulfill the objective that a application can have many users And
   as each group can further have a certain set of users, I found there's a need to create separate groups where we'll further have certain number of users who'll share the
   expenses amongst them. Once we're done creating groups, you can see the groups available by clicking on the 'Existing groups'. Second, you can add the corresponding details
   for the groups created by clicking on 'Add expenses', It'll allow us to add the necessary details for the respective groups. Once the details are added, we can further
   check the expense status shared amongst various users in a group by clicking on 'Expense tracking status'.
4. What are the dependencies which come with the application?
   Here, I'm connecting with the local database named 'TestDB'available at the MS SQL Server.
